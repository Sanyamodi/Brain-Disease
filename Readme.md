1. Data Acquisition: EEG signals are collected from external sources.


2. Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, noise removal, and feature extraction (mean, magnitude, etc.).


3. Model Training: Machine learning and deep learning models are developed for disease and mood prediction.


4. Prediction: The trained models predict diseases and associated moods.


5. Visualization: Graphical representations are created to compare the results and insights.
